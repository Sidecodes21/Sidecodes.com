Introducing the 6amMart Rental Module—an essential addon for the 6amMart Multi-Vendor eCommerce Solution. It brings a fully integrated vehicle rental service right to your platform. This module empowers vendors and delights customers with a user-friendly rental experience.

The 6amMart Rental Module simplifies the entire rental process from searching and booking to trip completion. Customers can easily search for vehicles by destination, pickup time, and trip type. Advanced filters help them narrow results by price range, category, brand, seating capacity, and cooling options. 

Once users choose a vehicle, they can see detailed information about it and the provider. They can also add promo codes for discounts and easily confirm their bookings.

Providers benefit from a streamlined workflow too. They can onboard the platform through self-registration. They can update vehicle details, assign drivers, and manage bookings efficiently. Real-time tracking provides transparency. It lets customers watch their trip updates and stay informed at every step.

That’s not just it! The 6amMart rental module is packed with convenient and flexible features for all stakeholders.
